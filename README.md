Some projects I've supported and currently recommend:

- [curl](https://curl.se/) - a critical library for transferring data
- [maintaine.rs](https://maintaine.rs) - a curated collection of stories from top open source maintainers.
- [ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms/) - a great toolkit and dataset on open source maintainers
- [Ladybird Browser](https://ladybird.org/) - an independent web browser
- [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) - Python is important :)

Once I used [data-driven approach to donate to top 866 Python OSS projects](https://kvinogradov.com/algo-sponsors/) via GitHub Sponsors, and it was a cool experiment.
